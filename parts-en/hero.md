# My Hero’s Journey – How I Left the System  

Many people dream of breaking free.  
Leaving the 9-to-5 grind, escaping the endless struggle for money, getting out of a system that restricts more than it liberates.  

I had that dream too.  
But my path was anything but straight.  

## The Original Plan – A New Life in Vietnam  

I had it all figured out:  
- **Save one year’s worth of unemployment benefits from Switzerland**  
- **Sell my Mercedes Cabrio as a classic car**  
- **Sell my BMW motorcycle**  
- And then? **Move to Vietnam and start over.**  

But life had different plans.  

- **My unemployment benefits were cut because I moved to Denmark.**  
- **The Mercedes burned down due to a heating system failure.**  
- **I had to sell my BMW for ONE Euro on eBay** because of customs issues – Swiss plates, but the bike was in Germany.  

The perfect plan? **Shattered into a thousand pieces.**  

## From Homelessness to My First Taste of Freedom  

With no money and no backup plan, I ended up living in my **Toyota Starlett**,  
parked at **Flensburg train station**.  
**That tiny car was now my home.**  

I could have given up.  
But instead, **I adapted.**  

I bought a **used motorhome for just 4,000 euros** – an old wreck, but it worked.  
For the next few years, I lived in it, parking around **Berlin**.  
Not always legally, but always freely.  

Then came **the awakening**.  

I read **"The Egg" by Andy Weir** – a short story that changed everything inside me.  
And I knew: **It was time to move on.**  

## Portugal – The Leap into the Unknown with €300  

I had **almost no money** – just **€300 in cash**.  
But I knew: **The universe would take care of me.**  

And that’s exactly what happened.  
All the way to **Portugal**, help came from unexpected places:  
- **People invited me for meals.**  
- **I found places to sleep without paying a cent.**  
- **Everything I needed came at the right time.**  

I knew: **I was on the right path.**  

## Surviving on Street Music – Until the Pandemic Hit  

In Portugal, I had **zero income**.  
No government benefits, no support.  
But I could **play music on the streets** – and it was enough.  

Then came **the pandemic**.  

- **No people on the streets** → **No music**  
- **No music** → **No income**  

But I had already written my first book:  
**Camp Eden** – a book about the world we could create.  

And suddenly, something changed.  

I started getting **royalties** – not much, but enough:  
- **€50 per month**  
- **Enough for rice, beans, and flour for chapatis**  
- **Even enough for a SIM card**  

## From Portugal to Vienna – Called to Speak  

Out of nowhere, I was **invited to speak at the UBUNTU Festival in Vienna**.  
The money for my fuel? **Crowdfunded.**  

After the festival, I drove to Germany to attend a **Querdenker demonstration in Berlin**.  
But I never made it there.  

Near **Bayreuth**, the police pulled me off the highway.  
**They scraped off my license plates on the spot.**  
Why?  
I hadn’t **paid tax or insurance for a year** on my motorhome.  

## Border Running with Expired Plates  

I got myself a **five-day transit license** and stayed in Austria for a month with friends.  
Then I headed **back to Portugal**.  

The problem?  
The five-day license had expired.  
I drove through multiple borders **illegally**, and no one stopped me.  

Until my engine failed.  
I left my motorhome to **a Rainbow brother’s mother**, who had been living in a tent.  

Then I **manifested a new van** – a **Peugeot** for just **€600**.  
It had **no papers**, so I stripped my old **Citroën** and transferred all the branded parts to the Peugeot.  
Now it was a “legal” Citroën – at least on paper.  

With my **expired five-day plates**, I crossed several more borders.  
**In Tirol, I got caught.**  

The police?  
They just let me go.  
**I guess they didn’t want to deal with a Freeman.**  

Once in Austria, I **put Portuguese plates on the van** – because in Germany, I would have been stopped again.  

## When a System Blocks You, Find Another Way  

Back in Germany, I wanted to register my van.  
But there was one problem:  

🚫 **No PCR test = No entry into the registration office.**  

So I gave away the van.  
And I switched to a bicycle.  

For a while, I **slept in a hammock in Berlin’s Mauerpark**.  
Until one day, I saw a sign:  

> **"Come to Lutherstadt Wittenberg – affordable housing available."**  

So I moved to Lutherstadt Wittenberg.  
Got a place.  
Started working again.  

But not for long…  

## The Next Plan – A Life on the Water  

Now that I have a base, I’m preparing for the next move.  
What’s the cheapest way to travel?  

💨 **Wind energy.**  

So I’m getting a **sailing yacht**.  
The goal?  
Scout for **land that is only accessible by boat** – so no police, no authorities, no control.  
A place where we can **build communities completely outside the system**.  

## True Freedom Comes from Trusting the Process  

Most people fear stepping out of the system.  
They think they need a perfect plan.  
They believe they need financial security first.  

**Bullshit.**  

I had **nothing** – and gained everything.  

I walked away from the system.  
I didn’t **fail, starve, or collapse**.  
**I’m freer than ever.**  

And if I can do it –  
**so can you.**  

## Conclusion: It’s Time to Walk Your Own Path  

What’s really stopping you from leaving the system?  
- **Fear of uncertainty?** → That’s just in your head.  
- **Think you need lots of money?** → There are other ways.  
- **Afraid of the government?** → They can’t stop you once you understand how the system works.  

The truth is: **We are free the moment we choose to be.**  
But no one can make that choice for you – except yourself.  

I found my way.  
Maybe it’s time for you to find yours.
