# Crowdfund to Take the System Down

## Her Vision

I met her in **Barcelona**, in **Parc de la Ciutadella**.
She told me she came from **Australia** and had been living in the park for many, many years.

When she was younger, she used to work there—blowing bubbles for children, making them laugh.
Now, she doesn’t do that anymore.

She **always finds something to eat** in the trash bins.
She is **free**.

### Homeless or Free?

I also lived in the park.
Yes, I was **homeless**—or should I say **free**?

I had nothing but **a sleeping bag** for the night, a **backpack** to carry my clothes —but not even a tent.
I had left my tent **months ago at a Rainbow Gathering in Austria**.
I wanted to travel **light**, and I had my **guitar**, which had been a **gift** from an elder woman.
I played a song for her once, and I guess she liked it—because she gave me the guitar as a present.

And so, I was living in the park now.
It was fine.

A few weeks earlier, I had slept on the ground in **Genoa**, surrounded by **wild pigs** on top of the city.
They were harmless.
Not like they told us in school.

### Her Idea

One night, **She and I** were drinking a few beers.

I told her about my past—about working for the **banksters in Zurich** as a software developer.
I told her that I have a **company** trying to fund projects with crowdfunding.

She looked at me and said:

***Let’s crowdfund to take the system down.***

At that moment, I didn’t fully understand what she meant.
But I **felt** it was a **good idea**.

### The Manifestation Begins

Months later, the idea started to unfold.

And now, I’m **writing this book**—so that you, too, will **know how to take the system down with crowdfunding**.

I know this might **sound silly**, but if you had lived my life, you would **know** that I am capable of **starting something big**.

And no—**this is not about terrorism**.
Not even about **violence**.

I’m simply telling you **how I see the world in the near future**.
I’m simply **writing it into existence**.

### Regnosis—Writing the Future Into Reality

You might have heard the term **prognosis**—a prediction of the future.
But this is different.

This is **regnosis**—a vision of the future, written **as if it already exists**.
You don’t predict what might happen.
You **write the future first**, and then you explain **how we got there**.

And in doing so, **you manifest it**.

I’ve done it before.

I wrote “**Camp Eden – How we re-created our paradise.**”
And now?

We have a **60-hectare community in Portugal**.
The land was **free**.

I just **met the custodian**.
